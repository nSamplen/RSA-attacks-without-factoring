# RSA-attacks-without-factoring

##Functional

1. P1 - implements the factorization of a composite number according to known RSA indicators and calculates the private key of another user in the case of a common module n.
2. P2 - implements Wiener's attack on RSA cryptosystem.
3. P3 - implements keyless decryption of the broadcast message in case of a low overall metric e.
4. P4 - generates parameters of the RSA cryptosystem. Key generation should ensure the generation of secure cryptosystem parameters, taking into account the attacks performed.
